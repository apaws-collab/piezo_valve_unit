## Data-driven pressure control based on Gaussian processes

Welcome to this project that demonstrates a data-driven pressure controller for Festo’s VEAE piezoelectric valves.

**Disclaimer**: This code is not plug-and-play due to variability in hardware and control system setups. However, it serves as a comprehensive guideline for building a high-accuracy pressure controller, following the outlined implementation steps.

We are currently working on a CAD version of the valve unit and the corresponding distribution circuit for the VEAE valves.

### m-code  
This MATLAB code provides a reference implementation of a pressure control framework for soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs), using Festo's VEAE piezo valves. Two valves are assembled in an SLA-printed housing to form a compact 3/3 valve unit. Due to its small size, the valve unit is designed to be mounted directly on or near the actuator. This proximity, combined with volume-adaptive control, enables high-precision pressure regulation.

The code was developed and tested on a MATLAB real-time target machine but is structured to be easily ported to microcontrollers, as it relies on LUT (lookup table) based implementations of the Gaussian processes.

The only external dependency is Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB, which is used for motion generation (see <https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/>).

**Procedure:**  
Start with the `pressure_control` script. It will guide you through the complete implementation process.
